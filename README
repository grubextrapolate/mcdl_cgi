mcdl_cgi - cgi interface to mcdl [http://mcdl.sourceforge.net/] 
databases

Copyright (C) 2002-2004 Russ Burdick, grub@extrapolation.net

this is a perl cgi interface to the databases created by mcdl (either
the original or my version above - the database structure did not
change). it is based on code published in one of my favorite Linux
Journal [http://www.linuxjournal.com/] columns, At The Forge
[http://www.lerner.co.il/atf/]. Issues 57-59 back in 1999 covered a 3
part article on "Creating a Web-based BBS". this was really where i
started playing with perl, cgi, and mysql, and what i got from these
articles really fuled my interest in perl and cgi programming. the cgi
pages include links to ATF to give a nod to Reuven.

features of the cgi pages include full library search, statistics on the
contents of the library, listings by artist, album, and song.

requires the following perl modules:

CGI
DBI
DBD::mysql
HTML::Template

setup is pretty simple:

1) copy the contents of the cgi-bin subdir to an appropriate location 
(such as your cgi-bin)

2) copy the contents of the html subdir to an appropriate location on 
you website

3) modify the settings in cgi-bin/cddb/CDDBConstants.pm to match your 
setup, in particular the db configuration and paths to the template.

4) depending where you put the html and cgi-bin contents in 1) and 2) 
you may need to modify the index.html and search-form.html files

5) optionally, modify the template file in html/templates to suit your
site.
