<H1>Search through the database</H1>

<p>This form allows you to search through the database of recordings in
my collection. Searches are <strong>case-insensitive</strong> (meaning
that "ABC" is the same as "abc"), and it will match your search as both
whole words or word fragments (meaning that searching for "cur" will
match "cure", "curve", and "cur").  This search looks through the albums
and information associated with each artist.</p>
